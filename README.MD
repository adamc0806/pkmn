# NEA POKEMON PROJECT

This is a text-based pokemon clone written in python using OOP (Object Oriented Programming).

To run:

1. Install the latest version of python (Currently 3.10.10)
2. Clone this repo.
3. Navigate to /src/menu.py.
4. Run menu.py.

IN THE FUTURE:

Python apparently can compile things so a compiled package will be available eventually :)
